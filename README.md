# Plant-Species-Classification-Using-Neural-Networks-Jan-2026

This project develops a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify plant seedling images into 12 species. The dataset was explored using class distribution analysis and image visualization, followed by preprocessing steps including image augmentation (rotation, shifting, shear, zoom, vertical flip), pixel normalization (0–1 scaling), and a 70/15/15 train-validation-test split. Class weighting was applied to address imbalance across species and improve model fairness.

The CNN architecture consisted of two Conv2D + MaxPooling layers for feature extraction, followed by Flatten, Dense (128 neurons), Dropout (0.5), and a Softmax output layer (12 classes), totaling ~7.39M trainable parameters. The model was trained using categorical cross-entropy loss and the Adam optimizer (learning rate = 0.001) with EarlyStopping (patience = 5) to reduce overfitting. Training stopped around epoch 9 as validation loss began diverging from training loss, indicating early signs of overfitting.

Final test performance achieved 67.6% accuracy, 0.686 precision, 0.676 recall, and an F1 score of 0.674, demonstrating meaningful pattern recognition across 12 classes and performance well above random guessing (~8%). The confusion matrix revealed difficulty distinguishing between visually similar species (notably Loose Silky-bent and Black-grass), highlighting class imbalance and feature similarity as key limitations. Overall, the project demonstrates practical experience in computer vision, CNN architecture design, regularization techniques, model evaluation, and performance interpretation using TensorFlow/Keras.
